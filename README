## Setting up the environment
Note: CppQuiz is still running on Python 2.7
- Clone this repository
- Install Django 1.9 (Yes, we probably should use virtualenv)
- `cp cppquiz/local_settings_example.py cppquiz/local_settings.py`, then edit at least `/path/to/your/code`
- Read the Django docs
- `python manage.py migrate'
- `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- `python manage.py runserver'
- `python manage.py create_questions 10` (Or whatever number, just so you have some dummy questions)

## Testing
### Setting up
- `sudo pip install mock`
- `sudo pip install six` If you're on OS X and get an error about importing `wraps`, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31417964/importerror-cannot-import-name-wraps

### Unit tests
`./manage.py test`

### System tests
The system tests are currently not maintained. If you want to have a go, you need at least `sudo pip install lettuce` and `sudo pip install splinter`. Then try to get `./run_lettuce` to work.
